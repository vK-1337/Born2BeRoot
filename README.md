# Born2BeRoot Bonus üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª

As part of the 'Born 2 be root' project, for the final part of the bonus tasks, we were required to implement a service of our choice. 

Therefore, I decided to set up a Node.js server.

Nothing extraordinary, but I had a lot of fun doing it!


To set up the same, you'll need to install the following on your machine:

Node.js: It provides the runtime environment to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. 

You can download it from the official Node.js website and follow the installation instructions.

Express.js: It's a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building web applications. 

After installing Node.js, you can set up Express.js by using npm (Node Package Manager).

Run "npm install express" in your terminal/command prompt within your project directory to install Express.js.

Once you have Node.js installed and Express.js set up, you can create your Node.js server and utilize Express.js to handle routing, middleware, and more for your application.
